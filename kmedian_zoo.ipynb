    "## $k$-median instances and graph notation\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a $k$-median instance, we need to give a collection of points $S$, a metric $d : S \\times S \\to [0,\\infty)$, the replication factor $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and the lower and upper bounds on the cluster sizes, $\\ell$ and $L$, respectively. For most real-world examples, the set $S$ is a finite set of points in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and the metric is taken to be the $2$-norm distance, $d(x,y) = \\Vert x - y \\Vert_2$. Most of the examples in the $k$-median zoo, however, are more abstract. We will often take the set of points to be $S = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and encode the problem entirely in the metric $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following graphical notation to describe the metric function $d$. Each node in the graph corresponds to a subset of the points in $S$, and the nodes taken together form a partition of $S$. Since the identity of the points doesn't matter, we simply label each node with the number of points it contains. If the label is ommitted, then the node contains exactly one point. The distances between points are determined by the edges in the graph as follows: The distance from any point to itself is always zero. If there is an edge between two nodes $a$ and $b$ in the graph, this means that the distance from any point in $a$ to any point in $b$ is $1$, and vice-versa. All other distances are $2$, including the distance between two points that belong to the same node. For example, the following graph describes a metric on $S = \\{1,\\dots,4\\}$ points, with distances given by $d(i,i) = 0$ for each $i$ in $S$, $d(1,3) = d(2,3) = d(3,4) = 1$ and all other distances equal to $2$:\n",

    "For $k$-median clustering with no lower bounds, the optimal objective value, which we denote by ${\\rm OPT}$ is a decreasing function of $k$. Surprisingly, when we add lower bounds on the cluster sizes, this is no longer true. Conside the following example with $n+1$ points:\n",

For $k=2$, the optimal clustering is to have the point on the left as one center, and one of the $n$ points on the right as the second center. \n",
